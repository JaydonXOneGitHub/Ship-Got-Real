# Ship-Got-Real

Another 3DS Homebrew game.
If you want to know what an example is,
check out https://github.com/JaydonXOneGitHub/Quik-Drop-3DS.

Once you extract the "3ds-template-master" zip file,
if you have devkitPro and libctru installed,
simply use the command "make" in the top directory to build it.
You can use CMD or a VS Code terminal to do it.
